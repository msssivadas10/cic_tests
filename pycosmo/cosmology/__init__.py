Cosmology Module
================

The cosmology module, `pycosmo.cosmology` defines the :class:`Cosmology` object. This object is the main 
tool for all the cosmology related calculations. This object stores a specific cosmology model and do all 
computations using that model. Also, there will be some specific models such as :math:`Lambda`-CDM model, 
which are implemented as subclasses of the base :class:`Cosmology` class.

**Todo**: Predefined cosmology model objects.
